# Master Student in Computer Sience

I’m Franziska Vollmer, a Master's student in Computer Science at the Technical University of Darmstadt, specializing in IT security, with a particular focus on hardware and system security. Through my academic projects and research, I have gained a deep understanding of the challenges and innovations in this field.

I am passionate about exploring security issues and thrive in research, where there is always something new to learn and discover. The field of IT security is constantly evolving, and I’m excited by the opportunity to tackle complex problems and develop innovative solutions. My goal is to contribute to research that not only enhances security but also opens up new possibilities for efficient and secure systems.

My areas of interest include cloud security, Kubernetes, hardware security, network security, satellite security, embedded system security (such as Trusted Execution Environments and ARM TrustZone), quantum computing, container security, and IoT security.

### About 
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Informatics and am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science with a focus on IT security. Alongside my studies, I work as a research assistant at the Technical University of Darmstadt, where I expand my expertise and practical skills in security topics. Previously, I gained industry experience in IT security consulting at KPMG and worked in the IT security department at the Higher Regional Court in Stuttgart.

My research has focused on the security of orchestration tools like Kubernetes and containers, as well as satellite security. These areas have allowed me to tackle complex, real-world security challenges in both infrastructure and space-related applications, helping me build a solid foundation in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in high-stakes environments.

Beyond my technical skills, I bring strong analytical abilities and a problem-solving mindset essential for addressing complex security issues. My experiences have also strengthened my teamwork and communication skills, enabling me to effectively convey technical insights to both technical and non-technical audiences. I am highly motivated to keep learning and adapting to new challenges in this dynamic field.
