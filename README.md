# Master Student in Computer Sience

I’m Franziska Vollmer, a Master's student in Computer Science at the Technical University of Darmstadt, specializing in IT security, with a particular focus on hardware and system security. Through my academic projects and research, I have gained a deep understanding of the challenges and innovations in this field.

I am passionate about exploring security issues and thrive in research, where there is always something new to learn and discover. The field of IT security is constantly evolving, and I’m excited by the opportunity to tackle complex problems and develop innovative solutions. My goal is to contribute to research that not only enhances security but also opens up new possibilities for efficient and secure systems.

My areas of interest include cloud security, Kubernetes, hardware security, network security, satellite security, embedded system security (such as Trusted Execution Environments and ARM TrustZone), quantum computing, container security, and IoT security.

### About 
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Informatics and subsequently began my Master's in Computer Science, focusing on IT security subjects. During my Master's studies, I am working as a research assistant at the Technical University of Darmstadt, where I deepen my knowledge and hands-on experience in security. Prior to this, I gained valuable industry experience at KPMG in IT security consulting and at the Higher Regional Court in Stuttgart, where I worked in the IT security department.

My research interests to date have focused on the security of orchestration tools like Kubernetes and containers, as well as satellite security. These areas have allowed me to explore complex, real-world security challenges in both infrastructure and space-related applications. Through this work, I have developed a strong foundation in identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in dynamic and high-stakes environments.

In addition to my technical expertise, I bring strong analytical and problem-solving skills that are essential for tackling complex security challenges. My experience has also enhanced my ability to collaborate effectively in teams and clearly communicate technical insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I am highly motivated to continuously learn and adapt to new requirements.
