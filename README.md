# Master Student in Computer Sience

My name is Franziska Vollmer, and I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at the Technical University of Darmstadt. My primary research focus lies in IT security, with a particular emphasis on hardware and system security. Through my projects and academic experiences, I have developed a deep understanding of the challenges and innovations within this field.

I am deeply passionate about exploring security challenges and love working in research, where there are always new areas to discover and learn about. The field of IT security is dynamic and constantly evolving, and I am motivated by the opportunity to dive into these complex problems and uncover innovative solutions. My goal is to contribute to groundbreaking research that not only advances security but also opens up new possibilities for secure and efficient systems.

My core interests lie in various areas of IT security, including cloud security, Kubernetes,hardware security, network security, satellite security, embedded system security, quantum computing, container security, and IoT-Security.

### About 
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Informatics and subsequently began my Master's in Computer Science, focusing on IT security subjects. During my Master's studies, I am working as a research assistant at the Technical University of Darmstadt, where I deepen my knowledge and hands-on experience in security. Prior to this, I gained valuable industry experience at KPMG in IT security consulting and at the Higher Regional Court in Stuttgart, where I worked in the IT security department.

My research interests to date have focused on the security of orchestration tools like Kubernetes and containers, as well as satellite security. These areas have allowed me to explore complex, real-world security challenges in both infrastructure and space-related applications. Through this work, I have developed a strong foundation in identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in dynamic and high-stakes environments.

In addition to my technical expertise, I bring strong analytical and problem-solving skills that are essential for tackling complex security challenges. My experience has also enhanced my ability to collaborate effectively in teams and clearly communicate technical insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I am highly motivated to continuously learn and adapt to new requirements.
